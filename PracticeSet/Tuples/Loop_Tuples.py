# Loop Through a Tuple

# You can loop through the tuple items by using a for loop.

# thisTuple = ("apple","banana","cherry")

# for x in thisTuple:
#     print(x)



# Loop Through the Index Numbers

# You can also loop through the tuple items by referring to their index number.

# Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.

# thisTuple = ("apple","banana","cherry")

# for i in range(len(thisTuple)):
#     print(thisTuple[i])


# Using a While Loop

# Use the len() function to determine the length of the tuple, then start at 0 and loop your way through the tuple items by referring to their indexes.

# thisTuple = ("apple","banana","cherry")

# i=0
# while i<len(thisTuple):
#     print(thisTuple[i])
#     i+=1

# apple
# banana
# cherry

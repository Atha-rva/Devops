# If Statements 


# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
# These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

# a = 33
# b = 200
# if b > a:
#   print("b is greater than a")

# b is greater than a


# 2 

# number = 15 

# if number >= 15:
#     print("Number is greater than 15")



# Indentation

# Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

# Note: You can use spaces or tabs for indentation, but you must use the same amount of indentation for all statements within the same code block.

# Multiple Statements in If Block

# You can have multiple statements inside an if block. All statements must be indented at the same level.

# age = 20

# if age >=20:
#     print("You Can Vote")
#     print("You are an adult")
#     print("You Have Full Legal Rights")


# Using Variables in Conditions

# Boolean variables can be used directly in if statements without comparison operators.


# is_logged_in = True 

# if is_logged_in:
#     print("You are logged in")


# (IMP)

# Python can evaluate many types of values as True or False in an if statement.

# Zero (0), empty strings (""), None, and empty collections are treated as False. Everything else is treated as True.

# This includes positive numbers (5), negative numbers (-3), and any non-empty string (even "False" is treated as True because it's a non-empty string).

# The pass Statement

# if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

# a = 33 
# b = 200

# if b > a:
#     pass 



# Why Use pass?
# The pass statement is useful in several situations:

# When you're creating code structure but haven't implemented the logic yet
# When a statement is required syntactically but no action is needed
# As a placeholder for future code during development
# In empty functions or classes that you plan to implement later

# age = 16

# if age < 18:
#   pass # TODO: Add underage logic later
# else:
#   print("Access granted")



# This will cause an error (empty code block):

# score = 85

# if score > 90:
#   # This is excellent
# # This will raise an IndentationError


# This works correctly with pass:

# score = 85

# if score > 90:
#   pass # This is excellent
# print("Score processed")


# value = 50

# if value < 0:
#   print("Negative value")
# elif value == 0:
#   pass # Zero case - no action needed
# else:
#   print("Positive value")


# pass in Other Contexts

# While we focus on pass with if statements here, it's also commonly used with loops, functions, and classes.

# Example
# Using pass with functions:

# def calculate_discount(price):
#   pass # TODO: Implement discount logic

# Function exists but doesn't do anything yet

# What is PIP?

# PIP is a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like.

# Note: If you have Python version 3.4 or later, PIP is included by default.

# What is a Package?

# A package contains all the files you need for a module.

# Modules are Python code libraries you can include in your project.


# Download a Package

# Downloading a package is very easy.

# Open the command line interface and tell PIP to download the package you want.

# Navigate your command line to the location of Python's script directory, and type the following:

# C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts>pip install package_name


# import camelcase

# c = camelcase.CamelCase()

# txt = "hello world"

# print(c.hump(txt))


# Find Packages

# Find more packages at https://pypi.org/.


# Remove a Package

# Use the uninstall command to remove a package:

# pip uninstall camelcase

# The PIP Package Manager will ask you to confirm that you want to remove the camelcase package:

# Uninstalling camelcase-02.1:
#   Would remove:
#     c:\users\Your Name\appdata\local\programs\python\python36-32\lib\site-packages\camelcase-0.2-py3.6.egg-info
#     c:\users\Your Name\appdata\local\programs\python\python36-32\lib\site-packages\camelcase\*
# Proceed (y/n)?


# List Packages
# Use the list command to list all the packages installed on your system:

# Example
# List installed packages:

# C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts>pip list
# Result:

# Package         Version

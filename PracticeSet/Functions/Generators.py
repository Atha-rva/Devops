# Generators are functions that can pause and resume their execution.

# When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which is an iterator.

# The code inside the function is not executed yet, it is only compiled. The function only executes when you iterate over the generator.


# def my_generator():
#     yield 1 
#     yield 2 
#     yield 3 

# for value in my_generator():
#     print(value)


# Generators allow you to iterate over data without storing the entire dataset in memory.

# Instead of using return, generators use the yield keyword.

# The yield Keyword

# The yield keyword is what makes a function a generator.

# When yield is encountered, the function's state is saved, and the value is returned. The next time the generator is called, it continues from where it left off.


# def count_up_to(n):
#     count = 1
#     while count <=n:
#         yield count
#         count+=1

# for num in count_up_to(5):
#     print(num)


# Unlike return, which terminates the function, yield pauses it and can be called multiple times.


# Generators Saves Memory

# Generators are memory-efficient because they generate values on-the-fly instead of storing everything in memory.

# For large datasets, generators save memory:

# def large_sequence(n):
#     for i in range(n):
#         yield i


# # This doesn't create a million numbers in memory 

# gen = large_sequence(1000000)
# print(next(gen))
# print(next(gen))
# print(next(gen))


# Using next() with Generators

# You can manually iterate through a generator using the next() function:


# def simple_gen():
#     yield "Emil"
#     yield "Tobias"
#     yield "Linus"

# gen = simple_gen()

# print(next(gen))
# print(next(gen))
# print(next(gen))



# def simple_gen():
#     yield "Emil"
#     yield "Tobias"
#     yield "Linus"

# gen = simple_gen()

# print(next(gen))
# print(next(gen))

# When there are no more values to yield, the generator raises a StopIteration exception:


# List Comprehension - creates a list 

# list_comp = [x * x for x in range(5)]
# print(list_comp)


# Generator expression - creates a generator 

# gen_exp = (x * x for x in range(5))
# print(gen_exp)
# print(list(gen_exp))



# Calculate sum of squares without creating a list 

# total = sum(x * x for x in range(10))
# print(total)


# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

# Generators can be used to create the Fibonacci sequence.


# def fibonacci():
#     a,b = 0,1
#     while True:
#         yield a 
#         a, b = b , a+b 


# # Get first 100 Fibonacci numbers 

# gen = fibonacci()

# for _ in range(100):
#     print(next(gen))


#  Generator Method 


# Generators have special methods for advanced control:

# send() Method

# The send() method allows you to send a value to the generator:


# def echo_generator():
#     while True:
#         recevied = yield 
#         print("Received: ", recevied)

# gen = echo_generator()
# next(gen)  # Prime the generator 

# gen.send("Hello")
# gen.send("World")


# close() Method

# The close() method stops the generator:

# def my_gen():
#     try:
#         yield 1 
#         yield 2 
#         yield 3 
#     finally:
#         print("Generator closed")


# gen = my_gen()
# print(next(gen))
# gen.close()

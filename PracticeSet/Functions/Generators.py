# Generators are functions that can pause and resume their execution.

# When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which is an iterator.

# The code inside the function is not executed yet, it is only compiled. The function only executes when you iterate over the generator.


# def my_generator():
#     yield 1 
#     yield 2 
#     yield 3 

# for value in my_generator():
#     print(value)


# Generators allow you to iterate over data without storing the entire dataset in memory.

# Instead of using return, generators use the yield keyword.

# The yield Keyword

# The yield keyword is what makes a function a generator.

# When yield is encountered, the function's state is saved, and the value is returned. The next time the generator is called, it continues from where it left off.


# def count_up_to(n):
#     count = 1
#     while count <=n:
#         yield count
#         count+=1

# for num in count_up_to(5):
#     print(num)


# Unlike return, which terminates the function, yield pauses it and can be called multiple times.


# Generators Saves Memory

# Generators are memory-efficient because they generate values on-the-fly instead of storing everything in memory.

# For large datasets, generators save memory:
